""" Various functions to facilitate the use of the GeoDa Center Xgrid.

Typical work flow might be as follows:

import grid_loader as GL
my_jobs = ['la', 'nyc', 'chi', 'sf']
job_ids = []
for job in my_jobs:
    xgrid_id = GL.load_python('compute_stuff.py', job, pysal=True)
    job_ids.append([xgrid_id, job])
GL.write_jids(job_ids, 'saved_ids.csv')
GL.results_runner(job_ids, 'results_folder/')

The script compute_stuff.py is the one sent out to the agents. This might
contain the simulation code. In the example, compute_stuff.py takes a command
line argument.
