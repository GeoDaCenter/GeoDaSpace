i've been doing some digging and here is what i've turned up thus far.

1) there is a sparse cholesky at http://pythonhosted.org/scikits.sparse/  
unfortunately it is a wrapper around CHOLMOD which has components licensed 
under GPL and LGPL. 
this makes it problematic for using in pysal since we would have to change 
to GPL and that removes us from the scipy/python scientific stack. for the 
thinking behind this bsd choice 
see: http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nipy/stable/faq/johns_bsd_pitch.html#johns-bsd-pitch

2) there are sparse eigenvalue methods in scipy.sparse, but they are constrained 
to return k << n eigenvalues. originally i was thinking that the determinant of 
A = I - pW could be obtained from the product of the eigenvalues, but if we 
don't have all of the latter, then no go.


3) i dug into the c code that is implementing the _superlu.SciPyLUType. 
originally that library actually has an output option for L and U but the 
scipy wrapper doesn't make use of that since they are focused on a solver 
and not the factorization elements per se. so i will try to talk to the 
particular guys i know who work on that and see if it would be possible 
to change the wrapping to hook into this. if they do it 
great :-> alternatively we could try it (might be an interesting project) 
and kick it back to them.

Sparse Cholesky Factorization on a Local-Memory Multiprocessor

There are lots of datasets with different sizes here, feel free to use 
them for testing (they're not public but range from address to tract):

tethys.asu.edu/HUD
userid: huduser

got to
/HUD/4Data

e.g. largest file is 11.8 million business points (with under 10 attributes):
/HUD/4Data/1National/6_ESRI\ Business Analyst_Points

a smaller one is BGs (186,174) but with 300 attributes):
/HUD/4Data/1National/1_Merged\ Data

closer to 70k (tracts)
/HUD/4Data/1National/5_2010_Census_Diff_Levels/2010Census/3_Tracts/2000\ Tracts

and ~37k zip codes (if I remember right):
/HUD/4Data/1National/9_EITC_2008 Zip
