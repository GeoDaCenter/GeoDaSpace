Instructions for spreg repository.

At the command line, do a repository checkout with SVN as follows:

svn co https://tethys.asu.edu/svn/spreg

You will be asked to accept the site's certificate. I choose 'p' for
permanently. 

If your asurite id name is different from your login name, simply hit enter
on the first challenge, and you will be asked to provide your username for the
repository, which is your asurite id. Provided you are a member of the geoda
group, ASURITE\m.clas.geog.geoda, this should go without a hitch.  If you're not, just send me
(phil.stphns@gmail.com) an email with your ASURITE Id name and I will manually add you to the list of authorized users. 

If you do not have an ASURITE id, well...I'll have to figure that out ;-)
