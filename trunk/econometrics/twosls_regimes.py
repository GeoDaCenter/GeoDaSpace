    Examples
    --------

    We first need to import the needed modules, namely numpy to convert the
    data we read into arrays that ``spreg`` understands and ``pysal`` to
    perform all the analysis.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pysal

    Open data on NCOVR US County Homicides (3085 areas) using pysal.open().
    This is the DBF associated with the NAT shapefile.  Note that
    pysal.open() also reads data in CSV format; since the actual class
    requires data to be passed in as numpy arrays, the user can read their
    data in using any method.  

    >>> db = pysal.open(pysal.examples.get_path("NAT.dbf"),'r')
 
    Extract the HR90 column (homicide rates in 1990) from the DBF file and make it the
    dependent variable for the regression. Note that PySAL requires this to be
    an numpy array of shape (n, 1) as opposed to the also common shape of (n, )
    that other packages accept.

    >>> y_var = 'HR90'
    >>> y = np.array([db.by_col(y_var)]).reshape(3085,1)

    Extract UE90 (unemployment rate) and PS90 (population structure) vectors from
    the DBF to be used as independent variables in the regression. Other variables
    can be inserted by adding their names to x_var, such as x_var = ['Var1','Var2','...]
    Note that PySAL requires this to be an nxj numpy array, where j is the
    number of independent variables (not including a constant). By default
    this model adds a vector of ones to the independent variables passed in.

    >>> x_var = ['PS90','UE90']
    >>> x = np.array([db.by_col(name) for name in x_var]).T

    In this case we consider RD90 (resource deprivation) as an endogenous regressor.
    We tell the model that this is so by passing it in a different parameter
    from the exogenous variables (x).

    >>> yd_var = ['RD90']
    >>> yd = np.array([db.by_col(name) for name in yd_var]).T

    Because we have endogenous variables, to obtain a correct estimate of the
    model, we need to instrument for RD90. We use FP89 (families below poverty)
    for this and hence put it in the instruments parameter, 'q'.

    >>> q_var = ['FP89']
    >>> q = np.array([db.by_col(name) for name in q_var]).T

    The different regimes in this data are given according to the North and 
    South dummy (SOUTH).

    >>> r_var = 'SOUTH'
    >>> regimes = db.by_col(r_var)

    Since we want to perform tests for spatial dependence, we need to specify
    the spatial weights matrix that includes the spatial configuration of the
    observations into the error component of the model. To do that, we can open
    an already existing gal file or create a new one. In this case, we will
    create one from ``NAT.shp``.

    >>> w = pysal.rook_from_shapefile(pysal.examples.get_path("NAT.shp"))

    Unless there is a good reason not to do it, the weights have to be
    row-standardized so every row of the matrix sums to one. Among other
    things, this allows to interpret the spatial lag of a variable as the
    average value of the neighboring observations. In PySAL, this can be
    easily performed in the following way:

    >>> w.transform = 'r'

    We can now run the regression and then have a summary of the output
    by typing: model.summary
    Alternatively, we can just check the betas and standard errors of the
    parameters:

    >>> tslsr = TSLS_Regimes(y, x, yd, q, regimes, w=w, constant_regi='many', spat_diag=False, name_y=y_var, name_x=x_var, name_yend=yd_var, name_q=q_var, name_regimes=r_var, name_ds='NAT', name_w='NAT.shp')

    >>> tslsr.betas
    array([[ 3.66973562],
           [ 1.06950466],
           [ 0.14680946],

           [ 1.94666348],
           [-0.30810214],
           [ 2.45864196],
           [ 3.68718119]])

    >>> tslsr.std_err
    array([ 0.46522151,  0.12074672,  0.05661795,  0.41893265,  0.16721773,
