    Examples
    --------

    We first need to import the needed modules. Numpy is needed to convert the
    data we read into arrays that ``spreg`` understands and ``pysal`` to
    perform all the analysis. The TSLS is required to run the model on
    which we will perform the tests.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pysal
    >>> from twosls import TSLS
    >>> from twosls_sp import GM_Lag

    Open data on Columbus neighborhood crime (49 areas) using pysal.open().
    This is the DBF associated with the Columbus shapefile.  Note that
    pysal.open() also reads data in CSV format; since the actual class
    requires data to be passed in as numpy arrays, the user can read their
    data in using any method.  

    >>> db = pysal.open(pysal.examples.get_path("columbus.dbf"),'r')
    
    Before being able to apply the diagnostics, we have to run a model and,
    for that, we need the input variables. Extract the CRIME column (crime
    rates) from the DBF file and make it the dependent variable for the
    regression. Note that PySAL requires this to be an numpy array of shape
    (n, 1) as opposed to the also common shape of (n, ) that other packages
    accept.

    >>> y = np.array(db.by_col("CRIME"))
    >>> y = np.reshape(y, (49,1))

    Extract INC (income) vector from the DBF to be used as
    independent variables in the regression.  Note that PySAL requires this to
    be an nxj numpy array, where j is the number of independent variables (not
    including a constant). By default this model adds a vector of ones to the
    independent variables passed in, but this can be overridden by passing
    constant=False.

    >>> X = []
    >>> X.append(db.by_col("INC"))
    >>> X = np.array(X).T

    In this case, we consider HOVAL (home value) as an endogenous regressor,
    so we acknowledge that by reading it in a different category.

    >>> yd = []
    >>> yd.append(db.by_col("HOVAL"))
    >>> yd = np.array(yd).T

    In order to properly account for the endogeneity, we have to pass in the
    instruments. Let us consider DISCBD (distance to the CBD) is a good one:

    >>> q = []
    >>> q.append(db.by_col("DISCBD"))
    >>> q = np.array(q).T

    Now we are good to run the model. It is an easy one line task.

    >>> reg = TSLS(y, X, yd, q=q)

    Now we are concerned with whether our non-spatial model presents spatial
    autocorrelation in the residuals. To assess this possibility, we can run
    the Anselin-Kelejian test, which is a version of the classical LM error
    test adapted for the case of residuals from an instrumental variables (IV)
    regression. First we need an extra object, the weights matrix, which
    includes the spatial configuration of the observations
    into the error component of the model. To do that, we can open an already
    existing gal file or create a new one. In this case, we will create one
    from ``columbus.shp``.

    >>> w = pysal.rook_from_shapefile(pysal.examples.get_path("columbus.shp")) 

    Unless there is a good reason not to do it, the weights have to be
    row-standardized so every row of the matrix sums to one. Among other
    things, this allows to interpret the spatial lag of a variable as the
    average value of the neighboring observations. In PySAL, this can be
    easily performed in the following way:

    >>> w.transform = 'r'

    We are good to run the test. It is a very simple task:

    >>> ak = AKtest(reg, w)

    And explore the information obtained:

    >>> print('AK test: %f\tP-value: %f'%(ak.ak, ak.p))
    AK test: 4.642895      P-value: 0.031182

    The test also accomodates the case when the residuals come from an IV
    regression that includes a spatial lag of the dependent variable. The only
    requirement needed is to modify the ``case`` parameter when we call
    ``AKtest``. First, let us run a spatial lag model:

    >>> reg_lag = GM_Lag(y, X, yd, q=q, w=w)

    And now we can run the AK test and obtain similar information as in the
    non-spatial model.

    >>> ak_sp = AKtest(reg, w, case='gen')
    >>> print('AK test: %f\tP-value: %f'%(ak_sp.ak, ak_sp.p))
    AK test: 1.157593      P-value: 0.281965
