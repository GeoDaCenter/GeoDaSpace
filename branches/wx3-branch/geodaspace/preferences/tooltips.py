tooltips.py: Contains tooltips for GeoDaSpace Preferences

The tips dictionary contains tooltips for wx widgets.
The dictionary key should be the name of the widget and the value the tooltip
for that widget.
To add new tooltips simply find the widget ID in the XRC file for the widget
you wish to identify.

Tooltips are added with the following logic...

Given:
window = preferencesDialog()
tips = {'CompInverse': "Warning for \"true inverse\": Slow Computation Times!"}

for widget in tips:
    if hasattr(window,widget):
        getattr(window,widget).SetToolTipText(tips[widget])
        getattr(window,widget+"Label").SetToolTipText(tips[widget])

notice that is the widget's Label is named "widgetLabel" the label will be
given the tooltip as well.
